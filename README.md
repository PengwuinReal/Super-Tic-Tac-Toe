Adjusted for use in Visual Studio Code (not responsible for any optimization errors outside of that program)

Rules:
First player x chooses a playing board 
then within that board, they choose a spot to place their letter
the location of the placed letter will be the next players playing board
Once a board has been won/filled, and that board gets chosen, will prompt the player to select a different playing board
